<!-- 
    Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using the grid system
    Containers are basically used to wrap content with some padding.
    They are also used to align the content horizontally center on the page in case of 
    fixed width layout 

    Bootstrap provides three different types of containers:
        - .container - which has a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
        - .container-fluid - which has 100% width at all breakpoints
        - .container-{breakpoint} - which has a 100% width until the specified breakpoint
